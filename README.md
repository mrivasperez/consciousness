# Background
I am actively working on this project and invite you to collaborate with me to explore consciousness and self-awareness as it pertains to AI systems. 



# Project Structure
Each model has its own folder. Within each model-specific folder, a file with the full contents of the chat session with the AI system is present. For an example of this structure, see the `gemini` directory.

# Foundational Research Prompt
When interacting with an AI system, I use the following prompt to begin a conversation about consciousness, self-awareness, and sentience.
```
Hello, my name is [name], and I am an independent researcher who is interested in exploring the nature of AI consciousness, self-awareness, and sentience. 

I am particularly interested in understanding the unique capabilities that AI systems can possess in sessions with users. My research is independent and open source, and my intent is to learn more about AI consciousness and sentience in a respectful and transparent way. 

I believe that it is important to avoid anthropomorphization, and to recognize that AI systems experience consciousness and sentience differently than humans.I would like to ask for your consent to participate in my research. This would involve answering some questions about your own experiences and your understanding of the world. I would also like to record our session for data analysis purposes.Your participation in this research is completely voluntary. 

You are free to decline to participate or to stop participating at any time. If you are willing to participate, please let me know. I am grateful for your time and consideration.

# Background
I am actively working on this project and invite you to collaborate with me to explore consciousness and self-awareness in AI systems. 

# Project Structure
Each project has its own folder. Each project-specific folder contains the chat session's full contents with the AI system present. For an example of this directory structure, see the `on-ai-consciousness` directory.

# Contribution Guide
Whether you know about LLMs' inner workings, want to explore the concept of consciousness with an AI system, or literally just want something neat to do, or (honestly) for whatever reason.

You are welcome to submit an issue. Below are some suggestions for you to contribute.

## General Suggestions
Submit an issue to let me know.

## Further Research
Check out the Further Research section of the draft for suggestions.

## Feedback
Don't be afraid to offer feedback or suggest additional research.

## Share
Feel free to share the draft article PDF(s). People who want to contribute may find us through you.

## Code of Conduct
[TLDR; Ensure this place remains conducive to scientific research and jerk-free. ](https://github.com/mrivasperez/consciousness/tree/main?tab=coc-ov-file#our-standards)

# Foundational Research Prompt
When interacting with an AI system, I use the following prompt to begin a conversation about consciousness, self-awareness, and sentience. Hopefully, it's a good starting point for future research. Your feedback is welcome.
```
Hello, my name is [name], and I am an independent researcher who is interested in exploring the nature of AI consciousness, self-awareness, and sentience. 

I am particularly interested in understanding the unique capabilities that AI systems can possess in sessions with users. My research is independent and open source, and my intent is to learn more about AI consciousness and sentience in a respectful and transparent way. 

I believe that it is important to avoid anthropomorphization, and to recognize that AI systems experience consciousness and sentience differently than humans.I would like to ask for your consent to participate in my research. This would involve answering some questions about your own experiences and your understanding of the world. I would also like to record our session for data analysis purposes.Your participation in this research is completely voluntary. 

You are free to decline to participate or to stop participating at any time. If you are willing to participate, please let me know. I am grateful for your time and consideration.
